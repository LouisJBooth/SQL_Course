    "## Selected Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago\n",
    "\n",
    "The city of Chicago released a dataset of socioeconomic data to the Chicago City Portal.\n",
    "This dataset contains a selection of six socioeconomic indicators of public health significance and a “hardship index,” for each Chicago community area, for the years 2008 – 2012.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scores on the hardship index can range from 1 to 100, with a higher index number representing a greater level of hardship.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed description of the dataset can be found on [the city of Chicago's website](\n",
    "https://data.cityofchicago.org/Health-Human-Services/Census-Data-Selected-socioeconomic-indicators-in-C/kn9c-c2s2), but to summarize, the dataset has the following variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Community Area Number** (`ca`): Used to uniquely identify each row of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Community Area Name** (`community_area_name`): The name of the region in the city of Chicago \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percent of Housing Crowded** (`percent_of_housing_crowded`): Percent of occupied housing units with more than one person per room\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percent Households Below Poverty** (`percent_households_below_poverty`): Percent of households living below the federal poverty line\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percent Aged 16+ Unemployed** (`percent_aged_16_unemployed`): Percent of persons over the age of 16 years that are unemployed\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percent Aged 25+ without High School Diploma** (`percent_aged_25_without_high_school_diploma`): Percent of persons over the age of 25 years without a high school education\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percent Aged Under** 18 or Over 64:Percent of population under 18 or over 64 years of age (`percent_aged_under_18_or_over_64`): (ie. dependents)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Per Capita Income** (`per_capita_income_`): Community Area per capita income is estimated as the sum of tract-level aggragate incomes divided by the total population\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hardship Index** (`hardship_index`): Score that incorporates each of the six selected socioeconomic indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Lab, we'll take a look at the variables in the socioeconomic indicators dataset and do some basic analysis with Python."
